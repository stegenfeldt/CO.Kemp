# CO Kemp Management Pack

The CO Kemp Management Pack (MP) is a System Center 2016+ Operations Manager MP that adds Kemp LoadMaster monitoring and discovery using its REST API.

It's an on-going development mostly payed for by Clas Ohlson AB with some spare time added by the [contributors](https://github.com/ClasOhlson/CO.Kemp/graphs/contributors).
